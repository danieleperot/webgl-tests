# WebGL Tests
How difficult can it be to use WebGL?

This repository uses TypeScript for two reasons:

1. I really want to try out TypeScript
2. I think that type hinting may help me to understand the hole situation better

## How To
```sh
# If you use NVM
nvm use # use node at the versione described in .nvmrc

# Using yarn to deal with packages
yarn

# Start the dev server
yarn start

# Build everything nicely in /build
yarn build
```

## Tutorials followed
